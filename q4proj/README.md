Note: For Screen 4 (the game board), we opted not to use stack panes as these may not give the desired effect of showing multiple shapes in one grid cell. We instead opted to use ImageViews, replacing the image of a cell every time its contents are altered in any way.

Special thanks to Franz Zingapan for his nuggets of wisdom!
